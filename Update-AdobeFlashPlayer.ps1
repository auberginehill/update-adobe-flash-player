Update-AdobeFlashPlayer.ps1

Requires a working Internet connection for downloading a list of the most recent 
Flash version numbers. 

Also requires a working Internet connection for downloading a Flash uninstaller and a 
complete Flash installer(s) from Adobe (but this procedure is not initiated, if the 
system is deemed up-to-date).

During the optional update phase requires to be run in an elevated PowerShell window 
(where PowerShell has been started with the 'run as an administrator' option). The 
elevated rights are needed for uninstalling Flash, installing Flash and for writing 
the mms.cfg file.

Please also notice that during the actual update phase Update-AdobeFlashPlayer 
closes a bunch of processes without any further notice in Step 3 and in Step 6 
Update-AdobeFlashPlayer alters the Flash configuration file (mms.cfg) so, that for 
instance, the automatic Flash updates are turned off.

If a working Internet connection is not found, Update-AdobeFlashPlayer will exit at 
an early stage without displaying any info apart from what is found on the system. If 
Update-AdobeFlashPlayer is run without elevated rights (but with a working Internet 
connection), it will be shown, weather a Flash update is needed or not, but the script 
will exit before actually downloading any files or making any changes to the system.

The Flash Player ActiveX control on Windows 8.1 and above is a component of Internet 
Explorer and Edge and is updated via Windows Update. By using the Flash Player 
ActiveX installer, Flash Player ActiveX control cannot be installed on Windows 8.1 
and above systems. Also, the Flash Player uninstaller doesn't uninstall the ActiveX 
control on Windows 8.1 and above systems.

For further info, for instance a command

help ./Update-AdobeFlashPlayer -Full

may be used at the PowerShell prompt window [PS>] in the folder, where the script is placed.

    (6) Configure Adobe Flash Player by creating a backup of the exisiting configuration files and writing new settings to the configuration files
        # Note: Windows PowerShell has to be run in an elevated state (Run as an Administrator) for this script to actually be able to write the mms.cfg files.
        # Description: "Adobe Flash Player Administration Guide": http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/flash_player_admin_guide.html
        # Source: http://www.klaus-hartnegg.de/gpo/msi_flash.html

            mms.cfg file location

                Assuming a default Windows installation, Flash Player looks for the mms.cfg file in the following system directories:

                    • 32-bit Windows - %WINDIR%\System32\Macromed\Flash
                    • 64-bit Windows - %WINDIR%\SysWow64\Macromed\Flash

                    • 32-bit Windows: C:\Windows\System32\Macromed\Flash
                    • 64-bit Windows: C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Macromed\Flash

                Google Chrome uses its own version of the mms.cfg file, saved at:

                   • Windows: %USERNAME%/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User Data/Default/Pepper Data/Shockwave Flash/System

                This System directory may not exist. If not, create it manually, but caveat emptor, directives such as those relating to updating Flash Player are not honored by Google in Chrome browser as Google embeds Flash Player in Chrome and all updates are released by Google.

            MSI and PKG installers do not provide update options and therefore do not set the update options in the mms.cfg file. To set the update option when installing Flash Player using the MSI or PKG installer deploy a custom mms.cfg file with the desired Update options.

            Starting with version 11.3, the installer contains both the 32 and the 64 bit version, and when running in 64-Bit Windows it will install both versions, which will both use the mms.cfg file from the directory SysWow64.

.SYNOPSIS
Retrieves the latest Flash Player version numbers, and looks for the installed Flash
versions on the system. If any outdated Flash versions are found, updates the three
Windows Adobe Flash Players (NPAPI and PPAPI in any Windows machine and ActiveX in
pre Windows 8.1 machines (On Windows 8.1 and above, the ActiveX Flash is updated via
Windows Update)).

.DESCRIPTION
Update-AdobeFlashPlayer downloads a list of the most recent Flash version numbers
against which it compares the Flash version numbers found on the system and displays,
weather a Flash update is needed or not. If a working Internet connection is not
found, Update-AdobeFlashPlayer will exit at an early stage without displaying any
info apart from what is found on the system. The actual update process naturally
needs elevated rights, but if, however, all detected Flash Players seem to be
up-to-date, Update-AdobeFlashPlayer will exit before checking, weather it is run
elevated or not. Thus, if Update-AdobeFlashPlayer is run in a up-to-date machine
in a 'normal' PowerShell window, Update-AdobeFlashPlayer will just check that
everything is OK and leave without further ceremony.

If Update-AdobeFlashPlayer is run without elevated rights (but with a working
Internet connection) in a machine with old Flash versions, it will be shown that a
Flash update is needed, but Update-AdobeFlashPlayer will exit with a fail before
actually downloading any files or making any changes to the system. To perform an
update with Update-AdobeFlashPlayer, PowerShell has to be run in an elevated window
(run as an administrator).

In the update procedure (if old Flash has been found and Update-AdobeFlashPlayer 
is run with administrative rights) Update-AdobeFlashPlayer downloads a Flash 
uninstaller from Adobe and full Flash installer(s) for the type(s) of Flash 
Player(s) from Adobe, which it has deemed to be out-dated, and uninstalls Flash 
completely. Several Flash-related processes are stopped before the downloaded Flash 
Player(s) is/are installed. Adobe Flash Player is configured by creating a backup of 
the exisiting configuration file (mms.cfg) and overwriting new settings to the 
configuration file. After the installation a web page in the default browser is 
opened for verifying that the Flash Player has been installed correctly. The 
downloaded files are purged from the hard drive after a while. This script is
based on Bob Ross' PowerShell script "Automated Adobe Flash Player Maintenance 
PowerScript for Public Computing Environment"
(http://powershell.com/cs/forums/t/6128.aspx).

.OUTPUTS
Displays Flash related information in console. Tries to update out-dated Adobe Flash 
Player(s) to its/their latest version(s), if old Flash Player(s) is/are found and 
if Update-AdobeFlashPlayer is run in an elevated Powershell window. In addition to 
that, if such an update procedure is initiated...


the Flash Player configuration file (mms.cfg) is overwritten with new parameters
and the following backups are made:


    Configuration file:

        32-bit Windows:   %WINDIR%\System32\Macromed\Flash\mms.cfg
        64-bit Windows:   %WINDIR%\SysWow64\Macromed\Flash\mms.cfg

        32-bit Windows:   C:\Windows\System32\Macromed\Flash\mms.cfg
        64-bit Windows:   C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Macromed\Flash\mms.cfg


    'Original' file, which is created when the script tries to update something for 
    the first time:

        32-bit Windows:   %WINDIR%\System32\Macromed\Flash\mms_original.cfg
        64-bit Windows:   %WINDIR%\SysWow64\Macromed\Flash\mms_original.cfg

        32-bit Windows:   C:\Windows\System32\Macromed\Flash\mms_original.cfg
        64-bit Windows:   C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Macromed\Flash\mms_original.cfg


    'Backup' file, which is created when the script tries to update something for 
    the second time, and which gets overwritten in each successive update cycle:

        32-bit Windows:   %WINDIR%\System32\Macromed\Flash\mms_backup.cfg
        64-bit Windows:   %WINDIR%\SysWow64\Macromed\Flash\mms_backup.cfg

        32-bit Windows:   C:\Windows\System32\Macromed\Flash\mms_backup.cfg
        64-bit Windows:   C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Macromed\Flash\mms_backup.cfg


To see the actual values that are being written, please see Step 6 above (altering 
the duplicated values below won't affect the script in any meaningful way) 


    AssetCacheSize = 0          Disables storing the common Flash components 
    AutoUpdateDisable = 1       Disables the Automatic Flash Update
    LegacyDomainMatching = 0    Denies Flash Player 6 and earlier superdomain rules
    LocalFileLegacyAction = 0   Denies Flash Player 7 and earlier local-trusted sandbox
    LocalStorageLimit = 1       Disables persistent shared objects
    SilentAutoUpdateEnable = 0  Disables background updates
    ThirdPartyStorage = 0       Denies third-party locally persistent shared objects


    Most of the setting above may render some web pages broken.

For a comprehensive list of available settings and a more detailed decription 
of the values above, please see the "Adobe Flash Player Administration Guide" at
http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/flash_player_admin_guide.html  

To open these file locations in a Resource Manager Window, for instance a command


    Invoke-Item C:\Windows\System32\Macromed\Flash\

            or

    Invoke-Item C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Macromed\Flash\


may be used at the PowerShell prompt window [PS>].  

.NOTES
Requires a working Internet connection for downloading a list of the most recent 
Flash version numbers. 

Also requires a working Internet connection for downloading a Flash uninstaller 
and a complete Flash installer(s) from Adobe (but this procedure is not initiated, 
if the system is deemed up-to-date).

For performing any actual updates with Update-AdobeFlashPlayer, it's mandatory to 
run this script in an elevated PowerShell window (where PowerShell has been started 
with the 'run as an administrator' option). The elevated rights are needed for 
uninstalling Flash, installing Flash and for writing the mms.cfg file.

Please also notice that during the actual update phase Update-AdobeFlashPlayer 
closes a bunch of processes without any further notice in Step 3 and in Step 6 
Update-AdobeFlashPlayer alters the Flash configuration file (mms.cfg) so, that for 
instance, the automatic Flash updates are turned off.

The Flash Player ActiveX control on Windows 8.1 and above is a component of Internet 
Explorer and Edge and is updated via Windows Update. By using the Flash Player 
ActiveX installer, Flash Player ActiveX control cannot be installed on Windows 8.1 
and above systems. Also, the Flash Player uninstaller doesn't uninstall the ActiveX 
control on Windows 8.1 and above systems.

Please note that the downloaded files are temporarily placed in a directory, which 
is specified with the $path variable (at line 41). The $env:temp variable points 
to the current temp folder. The default value of the $env:temp variable is 
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp (i.e. each user account has their own 
separate temp folder at path %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp). To see the current 
temp path, for instance a command

    [System.IO.Path]::GetTempPath()

may be used at the PowerShell prompt window [PS>]. To change the temp folder for instance
to C:\Temp, please, for example, follow the instructions at
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/23500-temporary-files-folder-change-location-windows.html

    Homepage:           https://github.com/auberginehill/update-adobe-flash-player
    Version:            1.0

.EXAMPLE
./Update-AdobeFlashPlayer
Run the script. Please notice to insert ./ or .\ before the script name.

.EXAMPLE
help ./Update-AdobeFlashPlayer -Full
Display the help file.

.EXAMPLE
Set-ExecutionPolicy remotesigned
This command is altering the Windows PowerShell rights to enable script execution. Windows PowerShell
has to be run with elevated rights (run as an administrator) to actually be able to change the script
execution properties. The default value is "Set-ExecutionPolicy restricted".


    Parameters:

    Restricted      Does not load configuration files or run scripts. Restricted is the default
                    execution policy.

    AllSigned       Requires that all scripts and configuration files be signed by a trusted
                    publisher, including scripts that you write on the local computer.

    RemoteSigned    Requires that all scripts and configuration files downloaded from the Internet
                    be signed by a trusted publisher.

    Unrestricted    Loads all configuration files and runs all scripts. If you run an unsigned
                    script that was downloaded from the Internet, you are prompted for permission
                    before it runs.

    Bypass          Nothing is blocked and there are no warnings or prompts.

    Undefined       Removes the currently assigned execution policy from the current scope.
                    This parameter will not remove an execution policy that is set in a Group
                    Policy scope.


For more information,
type "help Set-ExecutionPolicy -Full" or visit https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849812.aspx.

.EXAMPLE
New-Item -ItemType File -Path C:\Temp\Update-AdobeFlashPlayer.ps1
Creates an empty ps1-file to the C:\Temp directory. The New-Item cmdlet has an inherent -NoClobber mode
built into it, so that the procedure will halt, if overwriting (replacing the contents) of an existing
file is about to happen. Overwriting a file with the New-Item cmdlet requires using the Force.
For more information, please type "help New-Item -Full".
